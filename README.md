# Baybayin and Latin Text Images
For Baybayin and Latin block level recognition systems and other related studies.

## Contents
The dataset filename `Baybayin and Latin block text images.zip` contains 110 Baybayin and/or Latin block text images in .PNG format. Each of these images is numbered and transliterated into Latin (check 'Tagalog Translation List.xlsx' file).

The spreadsheet file, `Tagalog Translation List.xlsx`, contains the list of Latin transliteration of each image.

A document file, `References.docx`, is also uploaded for a list of where I took and snipped most of the Baybayin/Latin text images.

## Acknowledgments
A big thanks to the Baybayin Facebook Public Group named <b> Baybayin - Philippine National Writing System </b> where I have seen and cropped most of the collected block text images. The group aims to spread and restore the Baybayin writing system throughout the Filipino Nation and others. You can check their page here https://www.facebook.com/groups/Baybayin.PhilippineNationalWritingSystem. Mabuhay!

## Inspiration
These datasets are part of the ongoing restoration of the Baybayin script in the Philippines. Others may use some of these for Baybayin related researches.
